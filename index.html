                            This project was completed as my Engineering Capstone, where I developed and evaluated 
                            multiple AI models to predict CO₂ emissions in Australia. The goal of the project was to 
                            analyse historical emissions and related socioeconomic and energy data to determine which
                            modelling approach most effectively captured trends and produced accurate predictions.

                        <p>
                            Throughout the project, I was responsible for designing the end-to-end machine learning
                            pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model
                            selection. I implemented and compared several models, such as linear regression,
                            tree-based models, and neural networks, assessing their performance using appropriate
                            evaluation metrics.

                            Overall, this project strengthened my practical experience in applying AI techniques to
                            real-world environmental problems. It highlights my ability to critically evaluate
                            machine learning models, justify technical decisions based on empirical results, and
                            communicate meaningful insights from data—skills that are directly applicable to roles in
                            data science, AI, and sustainability-focused software development.

                            man team in which we created an ESP32 hosted application which could monitor and control
                            the humidity of a room. The application continuously collected environmental data such as
                            humidity and temperature using onboard sensors and used this data to make intelligent
                            control decisions in real time.

                            Throughout the project, I architected the ESP32 hosted webserver. This webserver included 
                            sensor integration and the control logic used to automatically activate or deactivate the
                            dehumidifier based on predefined thresholds. Features such as live humidity monitoring,
                            automatic control, and data logging were implemented to address practical user needs
                            around efficiency and indoor comfort. Graphs and charts where displayed to the 
                            user outlining the rooms current temperature, humidity and pressure while allowing them 
                            to set thresholds of when to turn on and off the dehumidifier based on these metrics.

                            technical solutions. It demonstrates my capability to design, build, and deploy a

                            With the project I architected much of the application, including front-end design and API implementation.
                            I was in charge of establishing the scope of the project given a limited time frame as well as determine what
                            features are included and how these features should be implemented. Emoji selection, image uploading and user

                            This project acted as a culmination of the embedded programming concepts I had learned,
                            including PWM, interrupts and ADC, requiring me to apply them in an integrated and
                            practical way. Through designing and implementing the system, I gained a deeper

                            to produce reliable functionality.

                            solve real-world problems. This experience strengthened my confidence in working with
                            embedded systems and provided valuable insight into the precision and problem-solving
